# BDVA-Data-Value-Creation-Framework
Systematic and structured approach that encompasses all elements needed to generate value from data along its whole value chain, specially in the data sharing phase, providing a way to organize, map and provide these components. A crucial class of these components will be technical enablers to connect data lifecycle to real use cases, applications and other instruments, but also elements for governance, interoperability, trust and monetization

The framework aims to incorporate a range of elements, from guidelines, recommendations, and best practices—synthesized from discussions with our members, projects, and experts—to specific components developed by them. These elements will be systematically mapped across the different layers and sections of the framework.

The framework will curate, synthesize, and organize insights from members and key initiatives

Eventually, this framework will: 
-	Enable scalability and interoperability in data-driven businesses.
-	Guide organizations on how to move from pure data collection to data monetization
-	Promote trust and compliance in cross-organizational data sharing
-	Provide a structured and reusable approach for industry-wide adoption
-	Facilitate the development of data spaces with clear business incentives
