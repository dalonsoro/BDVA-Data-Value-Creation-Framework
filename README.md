# BDVA-Data-Value-Creation-Framework

⚠️ **Work in Progress** ⚠️  

<small> This repository is currently under development and has not yet been formally validated by BDVA BoD, Technical Board and Task Force leads. Contributions and feedback are welcome, but please note that the framework is subject to changes </small>

## Concept and scope
Systematic and structured approach that encompasses all elements needed to generate value from data along its whole value chain, specially in the data sharing phase, providing a way to organize, map and provide these components. A crucial class of these components will be technical enablers to connect data lifecycle to real use cases, applications and other instruments, but also elements for governance, interoperability, trust and monetization

The framework aims to incorporate a range of elements, from guidelines, recommendations, and best practices—synthesized from discussions with our members, projects, and experts—to specific components developed by them. These elements will be systematically mapped across the different layers and sections of the framework.

The framework will curate, synthesize, and organize insights from members and key initiatives

Eventually, this framework will: 
-	Enable scalability and interoperability in data-driven businesses.
-	Guide organizations on how to move from pure data collection to data monetization
-	Promote trust and compliance in cross-organizational data sharing
-	Provide a structured and reusable approach for industry-wide adoption
-	Facilitate the development of data spaces with clear business incentives

## Value proposition
- Value for BDVA -> Establishes BDVA as a key player in shaping data-driven innovation, governance, and interoperability
- Value for our members -> Access to structured best practices, recommendations, and components for data value creation, connect with industry leaders, projects, and funding opportunities, strengthening partnerships
- Value for our community at large -> shared reference model that fosters alignment across different stakeholders, reduce fragmentation 
- Value for industry -> unlock new data driven innovation, access to best practices and use cases, reuse of existing components, access to innovative solutions, promote their own solutions, …
- Value for others (society, etc …) -> inclusive and equitable access to data-driven opportunities across different sectors, ethical, fair, and transparent data sharing that benefits citizens and consumers

## Expected timeline
### Phase 1 (2025)
- Define the concept 
- Validate concept, impact and value with industry and other key stakeholders 
- Initial structure of the framework 
- Create repository in GitHub
- Contribution guidelines / invite early contributors 
- Start populating the framework with content

### Phase 2
- broaden adoption
- refinement
- standardization
- monitor
- consider emerging trends

### Phase 3
- test real applicability
- governance
