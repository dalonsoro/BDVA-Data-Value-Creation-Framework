# BDVA supporting AI Factories

AI Factories represent the European Union’s key strategic initiative to position Europe at the forefront of AI innovation. They aim to establish advanced ecosystems that integrate high-performance computing, top talent, cutting-edge skills, and advanced services—all specifically tailored to the development and training of large AI models. Additionally, it is widely recognized that access to vast amounts of high-quality, purpose-specific data is essential to ensure the correctness, accuracy, and effectiveness of AI models. Consequently, seamless access to data stands out as a fundamental requirement for AI Factories

## Networking “layer” of AI factories

As per the communication of the EC (ref.), “all AI Factories will closely interact with each other to make their services accessible across Europe”. Considering the definition of AI Factories and the different elements composing them, AI Factories are likely to be quite heterogeneous and with different approaches depending on the country. This situation might lead to different degrees of misalignment, resulting in silos that could hamper the European dimension of AI factories, and the ultimate objective of “supporting the further development and scalability of AI models in EU”. This situation would also affect end users of the AI Factories, that, depending on the region or country, will have access only to a local set of services, lacking the opportunity to benefit from those services at EU level. 

Therefore, BDVA fully supports the implementation of a networking layer that homogenizes AI Factories at user level, with common governance rules that ensure fair and seamless access to services for EU users is required in order to fully achieve their objectives. Additionally, this layer can also facilitate the connection to other EU instruments, such as AI TEFs, data spaces, AIoD and EDIHs. 

BDVA can contribute with its experience on setting up its federation of BDVA i-Spaces (where a global governance scheme, business models, interoperability between i-Spaces, … are defined), relying also on the work done at the Data Spaces Support Center (DSSC) on data spaces interoperability (addressed at different levels: governance, business, technical, semantic), and the insights from the different activities driven around data interoperability 

## Link with industry (industrial AI)

AI Factories are intended both for research and industry, to address challenges in both domains, but also to respond to their different specificities. However, so far mostly the research community has been the one behind the use of EuroHPC supercomputers (being fostering their use by SMEs still one of the main challenges for EUroHPC), and it seems that this trend still continues in AI Factories, at least at the initial steps. 

This situation requires an effort to get industry onboard, and foster their participation in the discussion to identify specificities (not really need of new models, industrial models focused on specific sectors, pre-trained models for specific purposes …) and to understand their needs. Additionally, to check their willingness and interest to co-invest (together with the EC) in the setting up of AI Factories. 

BDVA, with 29 large industry and 50 SMEs members can play a key role to address this challenge, raising awareness, identifying barriers, discussing with the community how to do it, etc …

Additionally, and also related to the previous point, data spaces can be seen as collaborative ecosystems that bring together stakeholders (large industry, SMEs, …) around specific sectorial challenges, so their connection with AI Factories will entail the involvement of many of those stakeholders (to a certain extent) therein.  

## Looking at the whole lifecycle from lab to market / link with GenAI4Europe

It is important to identify how the different stages of the Generative AI lifecycle are supported by AI Factories, in order to guarantee the “lab to market” flow and to propose business models that can contribute to their sustainability, but also to ensure their optimal utilization in terms of efficiency (differentiating those steps more computing demanding as pre-training or training, from those that might not require not so much effort like fine-tuning or inference), and energy consumption. 
This balance between ensuring “from lab to market” and “efficiency of AI Factories” would require a discussion between different experts (AI lifecycle, HPC, energy, etc …), where BDVA can play a key role by bringing experts on the community and addressing the topic through the different Task Forces 

## Connection of AI Factories to Data and Data Spaces

AI Factories should include AI-dedicated supercomputers to train large AI models, which will require a huge amount of data. Data spaces appear as the ideal environment to provide this amount of data in an efficient, well governed and trusted way. Data spaces provide access to data coming from different domains, but can also guarantee the quality of the data to train AI models, provide exhaustive metadata description (including provenance) for its intended use, and enforce the required policies to guarantee the right access and correct use of the data.

Therefore, a work to identify and describe how HPC ecosystems can connect with data spaces seems mandatory. This work would include the European Commission, and representatives of both HPC and data ecosystems 

This connection should guarantee the seamless access from AI Factories to data available in one or several data spaces, and the conditions for its use to train AI models in AI Factories. 

On this regard, BDVA can play a key role in this discussion given its membership of EuroHPC JU and active participation in the Data Spaces Support Center (in contact with all domain-specific EU data spaces and with SIMPL) and Data Spaces Business Alliance.
